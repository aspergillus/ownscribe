Rules:
- No introduction, no closing remarks, no sections other than the ones above.
- Every section except Executive Summary is a markdown list: one item per line, each line starting with `- `. Never merge several items into a paragraph, however long the items are.
- The transcript may repeat itself. Mention each fact once, and never repeat an item across sections.
- Ignore greetings, filler and off-topic chatter. Do not invent owners, dates or facts.
- If nothing in the transcript fits a section, write exactly `None mentioned.` under its heading.
- Write in the language of the transcript.
